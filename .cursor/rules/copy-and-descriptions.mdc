# In-App Copy & Page Descriptions

Use **layperson, conversational language** for all user-facing text: page descriptions (e.g. `BannerHeader` description), card blurbs, empty states, and button/link labels where it makes sense.

## Style

- **Plain language**: Say what the page or action does in everyday words. Avoid jargon (e.g. "parcel," "legal name," "tracking and monitoring") unless the audience is technical.
- **Conversational**: Write like you're explaining to a friend. Use "you" and "your." Prefer "keep a list of" over "manage a collection of," "add" over "create an entry," "connect" over "link/associate."
- **Concrete**: When possible, give a short example or two (e.g. "your house, a rental building, a commercial space") so the user immediately knows what belongs there.
- **Brief**: One to three sentences is enough for a page description. Don't over-explain.

## Examples

**Page description (good):**
- "This is where you keep a list of every property you own or manage—your house, a rental building, a commercial space, or a piece of land. Add each one with its address and a few details; later you can attach units and tenants to them."

**Page description (avoid):**
- "A property is a real estate asset you own or manage—a building or parcel with a legal name, address, type (residential, commercial, industrial, or mixed-use)..."

**Card/short blurb (good):**
- "See and manage every property you own or look after."
- "Your home base. From here you can jump to your list of properties or your messages—everything in one place."

**Card/short blurb (avoid):**
- "View and manage your properties."
- "Welcome to PropMange. Manage your properties and messages from one central dashboard."

Dev-only routes (e.g. under `/dev`) can stay more technical. Apply this rule to all other user-facing copy.
